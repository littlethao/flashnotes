## Encapsulation (A major principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP))

Encapsulation is the process of hiding an object's internal state from another object while presenting only the interfaces that should be visible. Encapsulation comprises of data and operations on data in a single unit.

Hiding the internals of the object protects its integrity by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state.

A benefit of encapsulation is that it can reduce system complexity. Hiding complexity allows to provide a simplified and understandable way to use an object without the need to understand the complexity inside. Secondly, hiding complexity allows management of change.

From the user perspective, it means that a driver knows how to start a car, how to move a car, how to stop the car. The driver, however, does not need to know how the internals of a car works in order to drive the car. Same as, when the engine has been changed, the car still functions the usual way and the driver can still start, move and stop it.
