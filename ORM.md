## Object-relational mapping (ORM)

> Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

- The Object part is the logical representation of objects in our programming language (e.g. Ruby)
- The Relational part is a Relational Database Manager System, i.e. a database (e.g PostgreSQL )
- The Mapping part is where a bridge between the objects and the tables of a database.

> In a nutshell, object/relational mapping is the automated (and transparent) persistence
of objects in an [...] application to the tables in a relational database, using
metadata that describes the mapping between the objects and the database.
